.SYNOPSIS
Completes a policy compliance scan.

.DESCRIPTION
Starts a policy compliance scan and awaits it's completion. In case of a failure, the policy compliance scan is retried (Default: 3 times).

.PARAMETER ResourceGroup
The resource group to be scanned for policy compliance.

.PARAMETER MaxRetries
The maximum amount of retries in case of failures (Default: 3 times).

.EXAMPLE
$ResourceGroup | Complete-PolicyComplianceScan 
#>

.SYNOPSIS
Completes a policy remediation.

.DESCRIPTION
Starts a remediation for a policy and awaits it's completion. In case of a failure, the policy remediation is retried (Default: 3 times).

.PARAMETER Resource
The resource to be remediated.

.PARAMETER PolicyDefinitionName
The name of the policy definition.

.PARAMETER CheckDeployment
The switch to determine if a deployment is expected. If a deployment is expected but did not happen during policy remediation, the policy remediation is retried.

.PARAMETER MaxRetries
The maximum amount of retries in case of failures (Default: 3 times).

.EXAMPLE

.SYNOPSIS
Gets the policy compliance state of a resource.

.DESCRIPTION
Gets the policy compliance state of a resource. In case of a failure, getting the policy compliance state is retried (Default: 30 times) after a few seconds of waiting (Default: 60s).

.PARAMETER Resource
The resource to get the policy compliance state for. 

.PARAMETER PolicyDefinitionName
The name of the policy definition.

.PARAMETER WaitSeconds
The duration in seconds to wait between retries in case of failures (Default: 60s).

.PARAMETER MaxRetries
The maximum amount of retries in case of failures (Default: 3 times).
