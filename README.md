## Prerequisites

Outline the required components and tools that a user might need to have on their machine in order to run the sample. This can be anything from frameworks, SDKs, OS versions or IDE releases.

## Setup

Explain how to prepare the sample once the user clones or downloads the repository. The section should outline every step necessary to install dependencies and set up any settings (for example, API keys and output folders).

## Running the sample
