There is nothing inherently insecure about allowing requests to the public endpoint, however, you may wish to disable it to meet regulatory, legal, or organizational policy requirements. You can disable the public endpoint for a Storage Sync Service by setting the incomingTrafficPolicy of the resource to AllowVirtualNetworksOnly.",
