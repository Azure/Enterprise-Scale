# Policies included in Azure landing zones reference implementations

Azure Policy and deployIfNotExist enables autonomy in the platform, and reduces operational burden as you scale your deployments and subscriptions in the Azure landing zone architecture. The primary purpose is to ensure that subscriptions and resources are compliant, while empowering application teams to use their own preferred tools/clients to deploy.

> Please refer to [Policy Driven Governance](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/landing-zone/design-principles#policy-driven-governance) for further information.

## Why are there custom policy definitions as part of Azure landing zones?

We work with - and learn from our customers and partners to ensure that we evolve and enhance the reference implementations to meet customer requirements. The primary approach of the policies as part of Azure landing zones is to be proactive (deployIfNotExist, and modify), and preventive (deny). We are continuously moving these policies to built-ins.

## What Azure Policies does Azure landing zone provide additionally to those already built-in?

There are around 106 custom Azure Policy Definitions included and around 7 Custom Azure Policy Initiatives included as part of the Azure Landing Zones implementation that add on to those already built-in within each Azure customers tenant.

All custom Azure Policy Definitions and Initiatives are the same across all 3 implementation options for Azure landing zones; [Terraform Module](https://aka.ms/alz/tf), [Bicep Modules](https://aka.ms/alz/bicep), [Azure landing zone portal accelerator](https://aka.ms/alz#azure-landing-zone-accelerator).

This is because the single source of truth is the [`Enterprise-Scale` repo](https://github.com/Azure/Enterprise-Scale) that both the Terraform and Bicep implementation options pull from to build their `lib` folders respectively.

For a complete list of all custom and built-in policies deployed within an Azure landing zone deployment, please refer to the following [section](https://github.com/Azure/Enterprise-Scale/wiki/ALZ-Policies#what-policy-definitions-are-assigned-within-the-azure-landing-zones-custom--built-in).

> Our goal is always to try and use built-in policies where available and also work with product teams to adopt our custom policies and make them built-in, which takes time. This means there will always be a requirement for custom policies.

## AzAdvertizer Integration

We have worked with the creator of [AzAdvertizer](https://www.azadvertizer.net) to integrate all of the custom Azure Policy Definitions and Initiatives as part of Azure landing zones into it to help customers use the tool to look at the policies further in an easy to use tool that is popular in the community.

On either the [Policy](https://www.azadvertizer.net/azpolicyadvertizer_all.html#%7B%22col_10%22%3A%7B%22flt%22%3A%22ESLZ%22%7D%7D) or [Initiative](https://www.azadvertizer.net/azpolicyinitiativesadvertizer_all.html) section of the site, set the 'Type' column drop down (last one on the right hand side) to 'ALZ' and you will see all the policies as mentioned above in the tool for you to investigate further.

AzAdvertizer also updates once per day!

## What policy definitions are assigned within the Azure landing zones (Custom & Built-in)?

As part of a default deployment configuration, policy and policy set definitions are deployed at multiple levels within the Azure landing zone Management Group hierarchy as depicted within the below diagram.

![image](./media/MgmtGroups_Policies_v0.1.jpg)

The subsequent sections will provide a summary of policy sets and policy set definitions applied at each level of the Management Group hierarchy.

> **NOTE**: Although the below sections will define which policy definitions/sets are applied at specific scopes, please remember that policy will inherit within your management group hierarchy.

### Intermediate Root

This management group is a parent to all the other management groups created within the default Azure landing zone configuration. Policy assignment is predominantly focused on assignment of security and monitoring best practices to ensure compliance and reduced operational overhead.

### Sandbox

This management group is for subscriptions that will only be used for testing and exploration by an organization. These subscriptions will be securely disconnected from the corporate and online landing zones. Sandboxes also have a less restrictive set of policies assigned to enable testing, exploration, and configuration of Azure services. There are currently no policies assigned at this management group.

### Versioning

Each policy definition and initiative contains a version in its metadata section:
```json
"metadata": {
   "version": "1.0.0",
   "category": "{categoryName}",
   "source": "https://github.com/Azure/Enterprise-Scale/",
   "alzCloudEnvironments": [
      "AzureCloud",
      "AzureChinaCloud",
      "AzureUSGovernment"
   ]
}
```

This version is incremented according to the following rules (subject to change):
   - **Major Version** (**1**.0.0)
      - Policy Definitions
         - Rule logic changes
         - ifNotExists existence condition changes
         - Major changes to the effect of the policy (i.e. adding a new resource to a deployment)
      - Policy Set Definitions
         - Addition or removal of a policy definition from the policy set
   - **Minor Version** (1.**0**.0)
      - Policy Definitions
         - Changes to effect details that don't meet the major version criteria
         - Adding new parameter allowed values
         - Adding new parameters (with default values)
         - Other minor changes to existing parameters
      - Policy Set Definitions
         - Adding new parameter allowed values
         - Adding new parameters (with default values)
         - Other minor changes to existing parameters
   - **Patch Version** (1.0.**0**)
      - Policy Definitions
         - String changes (displayName, description, etc…)
         - Other metadata changes
      - Policy Set Definitions
         - String changes (displayName, description, etc…)
         - Other metadata changes
   - **Suffix**
      - Append "-preview" to the version if the policy is in a preview state  
         - Example:  1.3.2-preview
      - Append "-deprecated" to the version if the policy is in a deprecated state
         - Example:  1.3.2-deprecated
 
## Preview and deprecated policies

This section aims to explain what it means when a built-in policy has a state of ‘preview’ or ‘deprecated’.  

Policies can be in preview because a property (alias) referenced in the policy definition is in preview, or the policy is newly introduced and would like additional customer feedback. A policy may get deprecated when the property (alias) becomes deprecated & not supported in the resource type's latest API version, or when there is manual migration needed by customers due to a breaking change in a resource type's latest API version. 

When a policy gets deprecated or gets out of preview, there is no impact on existing assignments. Existing assignments continue to work as-is. The policy is still evaluated & enforced like normal and continues to produce compliance results.  

Here are the changes that occur when a policy gets deprecated: 
- Display name is appended with ‘[Deprecated]:’ prefix, so that customers have awareness to migrate or delete the policy.
- Description gets updated to provide additional information regarding the deprecation. 
- The version number is updated with ‘-deprecated’ suffix. (see [Policy Versioning](#versioning) above) 

> **NOTE:** The `name` value must not change in the file through deprecation or preview.
