# ALZ Policies - Extra

This section contains additional policies that are not covered in the core ALZ Policies documentation, and provides guidance on how to handle certain situations.

## 1. ALZ Core

The Azure Landing Zone provides several additional policies and initiatives that are not assigned by default. These policies and initiatives are not necessary for all organizations and need additional considerations before being implemented.

## 2. ALZ Provided Policies for specific scenarios

ALZ provides policies that can be used for specific scenarios that may not be obvious.

| Policy | Description | Recommended |
|------------|-------------|-------------|


## 2. ALZ and Regulated Industries

The Azure Landing Zone is designed to be a flexible and scalable solution that can be used by organizations in a variety of industries. However, organizations in regulated industries may need to take additional steps to ensure compliance with industry-specific regulations. To support the additional requirements of these industries, we're providing the following additional initiatives that significantly enhance the security and compliance posture of the Azure Landing Zone:

| Initiative | Description | Recommended Industry |
|------------|-------------|-------------|
| Enforce-Guardrails-APIM | Enforce secure-by-default API Management for regulated industries | FSI |
