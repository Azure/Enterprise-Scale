### January 2024

#### Tooling

- Bug fix for Portal Accelerator, removing region restrictions for VPN Gateways when deploying regional (not AZ).
- Bug fix for Portal Accelerator deployment when deploying using a single platform subscription. Previously, a single tenant deployment would have three failed deployments for diagnostic settings which were looking for non-existent management groups (Management, Identity and Connectivity). This has been fixed and the deployment will now succeed.
- Added drop down selection option for Azure Private Link Private DNS Zones as part of portal based ALZ deployment experience where you can select to deploy or not to deploy a subset of Private Link Private DNS zones.
- Updated ALZ policy testing framework on pull request to only test new or changed policies, drastically speeding up the testing process.

### December 2023

#### Tooling

- Added a new policy/initiative submission form template for GitHub Issues. This will help us to better understand the policy/initiative you are submitting and will help us to review and approve the submission faster. Please use this template when submitting new policies/initiatives to the ALZ GitHub Issues page.

### April 2023

We are pleased to announce that we are starting regular Azure Policy reviews for Azure Landing Zone. This includes a review of new built-in policies released and their suitability for ALZ, built-in policies that can replace custom ALZ policies, built-in policies that have been deprecated and addition of new ALZ custom policies and initiatives as identified based on best practices, issues raised and customer feedback. Most importantly, we have also provided default assignments for all the new policies at the appropriate ALZ Management Group level. This will ensure that all new policies are automatically assigned to the appropriate scope and will be in compliance with the ALZ baseline. This will also ensure that the ALZ is always up to date with the latest Azure Policy definitions.

This update includes many ALZ Azure Policies and Initiatives that have been added or updated to enhance the security, governance, and management of ALZ. As part of our commitment to continuous improvement, we have also enhanced our policy review  process, with a focus on transitioning away from deprecated policies where possible, move from custom to built-in policies providing the same or enhanced functionality, and implementing new policies to keep ALZ as part of the current review cycle. We have also implemented non-compliance messages where supported to provide a better user experience when a policy is non-compliant.

This is the first major review and refresh of Azure Policy since ALZ was GA'd. Since GA many new built-in policies and initiatives have been released which has driven the need for this review. We believe that a regular review cycle will allow us to stay on top of emerging trends and new policies, ensuring that our Azure environment remains secure and compliant. Should you identify policies or initiatives that should be considered for ALZ, kindly submit an [GitHub issue](https://github.com/Azure/Enterprise-Scale/issues). For more information, please refer to the [ALZ Policies](ALZ-Policies.md) or the new [Excel spreadsheet](media/ALZ%20Policy%20Assignments%20v2.xlsx) version.

We strongly advise staying up-to-date to ensure the best possible security posture for your Azure environment, see [Keep your Azure landing zone up to date](https://aka.ms/alz/update). For those with existing deployments or policies, we have provided [Brownfield guidance](https://aka.ms/alz/brownfield) to help you navigate the process of updating to the latest policies. We recognize that there may be breaking changes when upgrading an existing deployment or policies and for details follow our recently released guidance to support you in this process:

- [Update Azure landing zone custom policies](https://aka.ms/alz/update/custom)
- [Migrate Azure landing zone policies to Azure built-in policies](https://aka.ms/alz/update/builtin)

> **Please note** that, in some cases, moving to the new Built-In Policy definitions, deploying changes to existing custom policies or removing deprecated policies will require a new Policy Assignment and removing the previous Policy Assignment, which will mean compliance history for the Policy Assignment will be lost. However, if you have configured your Activity Logs and Security Center to export to a Log Analytics Workspace, Policy Assignment historic data will be stored here as per the retention duration configured. Thank you for your cooperation, and we look forward to continuing to work with you to ensure the security and compliance of our Azure environment.

> While we've made every effort to test the stability of this release, should you have any issues and the guidance provided does not resolve your issue, please open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/Azure/Enterprise-Scale/issues) so we can do our best to support you and document the fix for others.

#### Policy

##### Breaking Changes

Note that a number of initiatives have been updated that will fail to deploy if you have existing deployments. This is due to the fact that the number of parameters and default values have changed, as we've added or removed policies from the initiative. To resolve this, you will need to remove the existing initiative assignments and then redeploy the updated initiative.

| Initiative Name | Change | Recommended Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Deny or Deploy and append TLS requirements and SSL enforcement on resources without Encryption in transit (azadvertizer.net)](https://www.azadvertizer.net/azpolicyinitiativesadvertizer/Enforce-EncryptTransit.html) | Removed a deprecated policy, superceding policy is already in the initiative | Remove existing initiative assignment, delete the custom initiative and remove the orphaned identity.

### October 2022

#### Docs

- Added 2 new FAQ Q&As based on issue [#1080](https://github.com/Azure/Enterprise-Scale/issues/1080)
  - [What happens if I have existing Management Groups that have the same Name/IDs as ones that will be deployed in the ALZ Portal Accelerator?](https://github.com/Azure/Enterprise-Scale/wiki/FAQ#what-happens-if-i-have-existing-management-groups-that-have-the-same-nameids-as-ones-that-will-be-deployed-in-the-alz-portal-accelerator)
  - [What are the ALZ Portal Accelerator Management Group Name/IDs that are created?](https://github.com/Azure/Enterprise-Scale/wiki/FAQ#what-are-the-alz-portal-accelerator-management-group-nameids-that-are-created)

#### Tooling

- Release [`v2.4.1`](https://github.com/Azure/terraform-azurerm-caf-enterprise-scale/releases/tag/v2.4.1) of the Azure landing zones Terraform module adds a new diagnostic category for Azure Firewall, as reported in issue [#1063](https://github.com/Azure/Enterprise-Scale/issues/1063)
- Update the Azure landing zone portal accelerator to use Resource Graph with a generic drop down UI element to improve user experience for subscription selection.
- Update the Azure landing zone portal accelerator to have more unique naming for deployment names in same tenant, using `utcNow()` function in `deploymentSuffix` variable - fixes [#1077](https://github.com/Azure/Enterprise-Scale/issues/1077)
- Update the Azure landing zone portal accelerator to have more unique naming for vNet names - fixes [#881](https://github.com/Azure/Enterprise-Scale/issues/881)
  - vNet naming pattern changed:
    - **From:**
      - Identity vNet: `<Subscription ID>-<Root ID Prefix>-vnet-<Region Short Name>`
      - Corp vNets: `<Subscription ID>-<Root ID Prefix>-vnet-<Region Short Name>`
    - **To:**
      - Identity vNet: `<Root ID Prefix>-vnet-<Region Short Name>-<Subscription ID>` (then trimmed to 64 characters, using `take()` function, starting at front - so Subscription ID will get trimmed)
      - Corp vNets: `<Root ID Prefix>-vnet-<Region Short Name>-<Subscription ID>` (then trimmed to 64 characters, using `take()` function, starting at front - so Subscription ID will get trimmed)
  - **⚠️This is a breaking change, only if you attempt to redeploy the Azure landing zone portal accelerator over the top of an existing Azure landing zone portal accelerator deployment that was deployed prior to 12/10/2022 (12th October 2022)⚠️**
    - The outcome if you do this will be that new vNets will be created based on what you input into the Azure landing zone portal accelerator form when you fill it out. Even if you input exactly the same inputs and details as the first time you deployed it.
      - However, this is a very uncommon action and if you are impacted [please raise an issue](https://github.com/Azure/Enterprise-Scale/issues) on the repo and we can assist further

#### Policy

- Various custom ESLZ Azure Policies have moved to Built-In Azure Policies, see below table for more detail:

> You may continue to use the ESLZ custom Azure Policy as it will still function as it does today. However, we recommend you move to assigning the new Built-In version of the Azure Policy.
> 
> **Please note** that moving to the new Built-In Policy Definition will require a new Policy Assignment and removing the previous Policy Assignment, which will mean compliance history for the Policy Assignment will be lost. However, if you have configured your Activity Logs and Security Center to export to a Log Analytics Workspace; Policy Assignment historic data will be stored here as per the retention duration configured.

**Policy Definitions Updates**
