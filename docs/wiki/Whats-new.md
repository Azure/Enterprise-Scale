#### Tooling

- Portal Experience Updated
  - Merged Contoso, AdventureWorks, and Wingtip into one ESLZ deployment experience via first-party deployment in the portal ("Deploy To Azure" button) experience
    - Support "N" network topologies in same experience (Hub and Spoke, Virtual WAN, Hub and Spoke with NVA)
    - Added option for VNET Peering the Identity subscription's VNET to the Connectivity subscription's Hub VNET
    - Added option for VNET peering Landing Zones to Connectivity subscription when Hub & Spoke is the selected topology (Virtual WAN is excluded due to concurrency issues, at this time) - closing issue [#517](https://github.com/Azure/Enterprise-Scale/issues/517)

  - `eslzArm.json` is used to orchestrate the E2E composition of ESLZ, and subsequent resource deployments based on user input from the portal ("Deploy To Azure" button) experience
  - The composite ARM templates can be sequenced on their own, independently of each other (although strict sequencing is required to ensure the same outcome)
    - Guidance coming soon for this
  - Customers can deploy from private repository if they want to sequence at their own pace.
- ~~[AzOps release v1.3.0](https://github.com/Azure/AzOps/releases/tag/1.3.0)~~ 
- ~~[AzOps release v1.3.1](https://github.com/Azure/AzOps/releases/tag/1.3.1)~~
- [AzOps release v1.4.0](https://github.com/Azure/AzOps/releases/tag/1.4.0)

#### Policy

- Various custom ESLZ Azure Policies have moved to Built-In Azure Policies, see below table for more detail:

> You may continue to use the ESLZ custom Azure Policy as it will still function as it does today. However, we recommend you move to assigning the new Built-In version of the Azure Policy. 
> 
> **Please note** that moving to the new Built-In Policy Definition will require a new Policy Assignment and removing the previous Policy Assignment, which will mean compliance history for the Policy Assignment will be lost. However, if you have configured your Activity Logs and Security Center to export to a Log Analytics Workspace; Policy Assignment historic data will be stored here as per the retention duration configured.
