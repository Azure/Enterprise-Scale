# Azure Landing Zones Deprecated Notices

## In this section

- [Deprecated Policies](#deprecated-policies)
- [Deprecated Services](#deprecated-services)

## Overview

As policies and services are further developed by Microsoft, one or more Azure Landing Zone (ALZ) components may be superseded and need to be deprecated. This article provides details as to those items and supporting documentation to help you remain up to date.

## Deprecated policies

New Azure Policies are being developed and created by product groups that support their services and are typically of the `built-in` type. These new policies often replace legacy policies which get deprecated and usually provide guidance on which policy to use instead. Azure Landing Zones (ALZ) policies are not exempt from this, and over time some policies will be updated to leverage new `built-in` policies instead of ALZ `custom` policies. Through this process, `custom` ALZ policies will be deprecated when new `built-in` policies are available that provide the same capability, which ultimately reduces maintenance overhead for `custom` policies.  

Policies being deprecated:

## Deprecated services

- Removed `ActivityLog` Solution as an option to be deployed into the Log Analytics Workspace, as this has been superseded by the Activity Log Insights Workbook, as documented [here.](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/activity-log-insights)
- Removed `Service Map` solution as an option to be deployed, as this has been superseded by VM Insights, as documented [here.](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/activity-log-insights) Guidance on migrating and removing the Service Map solution can be found [here.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/vm/vminsights-migrate-from-service-map)

- Due to Microsoft Monitor Agent (MMA) planned for deprecation (August 2024) we have started to remove MMA from our reference implementations starting with the ALZ Portal (https://aka.ms/alz/portal) and following this will start to remove MMA from Bicep and Terraform before the planned deprecation date. Please see [MMA Deprecation Guidance](/docs/wiki/ALZ-AMA-Update.md) for more details.
