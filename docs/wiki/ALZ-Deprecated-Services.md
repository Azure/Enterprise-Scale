# Azure Landing Zones Deprecated Services

## In this section

- [Azure Landing Zones Deprecated Services](#azure-landing-zones-deprecated-services)

## Overview

As built-in services are further developed by Microsoft, one or more Azure Landing Zone (ALZ) components may be superseded.

## Deprecated policies

New Azure Policies are being developed and created constantly as a `built-in` type. Azure Landing Zones (ALZ) policies are not exempt from this, so over time some policies will be included as `built-in` from `ALZ` or `custom` types. This will lead to duplicate policies being created and additional admin overhead of maintenance.

Over time, a deprecation process of there `ALZ / custom` policies will have to take place. To learn more about the deprecation process, see the following documentation:
