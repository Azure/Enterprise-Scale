# Azure Landing Zones Deprecated Policies and Services

## In this section

- [Deprecated Policies](#deprecated-policies)
- [Deprecated Services](#deprecated-services)

## Overview

As policies and services are further developed by Microsoft, one or more Azure Landing Zone (ALZ) components may be superseded and need to be deprecated.

## Deprecated policies

New Azure Policies are being developed and created by product groups that support their services and are typically of the `built-in` type. These new policies often replace legacy policies which get deprecated and usually provide guidance on which policy to use instead. Azure Landing Zones (ALZ) policies are not exempt from this, and over time some policies will be updated to leverage new `built-in` policies instead of ALZ `custom` policies. Through this process, `custom` ALZ policies will be deprecated when new `built-in` policies are available that provide the same capability, which ultimately reduces maintenance overhead for `custom` policies.  To learn more about the deprecation process, see the following documentation: [Azure Policy - Preview and deprecated policies](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/README.md#preview-and-deprecated-policies)

## Deprecated services

- Removed `ActivityLog` Solution as an option to be deployed into the Log Analytics Workspace, as this has been superseded by the Activity Log Insights Workbook, as documented [here.](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/activity-log-insights)
