### Deprecating ALZ Policies

New Azure Policies are being developed and created constantly as a `built-in` type. Azure Landing Zones (ALZ) policies are not exempt from this, so over time some policies will be included as `built-in` from `ALZ` or `custom` types. This will lead to duplicate policies being created and additional admin overhead of maintenance.

Over time, a deprecation process of there `ALZ / custom` policies will have to take place. To learn more about the deprecation process, see the following documentation:
