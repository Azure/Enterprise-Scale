## Azure landing zone portal deployment for Platform DevOps and Automation

### Important Notice:

As of May 2023, the Azure Portal experience (accelerator) of the ALZ Reference Implementation (RI), will not include the "Platform DevOps and automation" section anymore.

Consequently, users interested in Platform DevOps and Automation, are encouraged to use either the respective [ALZ Bicep Modules](https://github.com/Azure/ALZ-Bicep), or the [ALZ Terraform Module](https://github.com/Azure/terraform-azurerm-caf-enterprise-scale).

> [AzOps](https://github.com/Azure/AzOps) can still be used, if desired, but please see the [AzOps](https://github.com/Azure/AzOps) repo for setup and configuration instructions as well as any support requirements via the repos issues.
