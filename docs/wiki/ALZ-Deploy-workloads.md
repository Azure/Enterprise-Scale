# Deploy workloads into the landing zones

At this point you have the necessary platform setup and landing zones (subscriptions) created and placed into their respective management groups, being secure, governed, monitored, and enabled for autonomy and are ready for your application teams to do workload deployments, migrations, and net-new development to their landing zones.

The following workloads outlined here provides best-practices, and curated deployment experiences for your application teams to successfully deploy them into their landing zones (online, corp).

Please head to the Azure Architecture Page called [Deploy Azure landing zones](https://aka.ms/alz/aac) for more information and links to workload accelerators and much more.
