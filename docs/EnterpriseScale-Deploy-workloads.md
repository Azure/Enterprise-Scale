# Create workloads into the landing zones

At this point you have the necessary platform setup and landing zones (subscriptions) created and placed into their respective management groups, being secure, governed, monitored, and enabled for autonomy and are ready for workload deployments, migrations, and net-new development in Azure

The following workloads outlined here provides best-practices, and curated deployment experiences to successfully be deployed into your landing zones (online, corp).

## AKS (Kubernetes)

Deploy Kubernetes to Azure and integrate with ARM, Azure AD, Azure Policy, and Azure Monitor to ensure you have a production ready Kubernetes cluster in your landing zone
