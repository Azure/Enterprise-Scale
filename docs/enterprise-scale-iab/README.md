# Introduction to Enterprise-Scale "in-a-box"

This section describes how to deploy the Enterprise-Scale 1st party reference implementation to get familiar with the key concepts behind the Enterprise-Scale foundation approach using a single subscription.

> Important:  
> The intent of this document is to provide a learning and a demo environment to explore the different angles of Enterprise-Scale reference implementation. This should **not** be used as a sample production environment. The environment created as you follow the steps in this document are for learning and hands on experience **only**.

Before deploy the Enterprise-Scale reference implementation, take the time to learn more about the [architecture](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/enterprise-scale/architecture), [design principles](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/enterprise-scale/design-principles), and [critical design](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/enterprise-scale/design-guidelines#critical-design-areas) areas related to the Enterprise-Scale architecture.

Before start following the steps below, please make sure that you have all the [prerequisites installed and configured](../Deploy/getting-started.md). This tutorial contains the following four sections which should be execute it in the given order below:

* [Deploy your tenant](./deploy-tenant.md)
