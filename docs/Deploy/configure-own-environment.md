# Deploy Enterprise-Scale reference implementation in your own environment

This section will guide you through the process of deploy an Enterprise-Scale reference implementation in your own environment.

To deploy a sample Enterprise-Scale reference implementation, simply choose your favorite implementation (for example Contoso) and click on the Deploy to Azure button. You can use any of the reference implementations included within Enterprise-Scale 
- [WingTip](../reference/wingtip/README.md)
- [AdventureWorks](../reference/adventureworks/README.md) 
- [Contoso reference implementations](../reference/contoso/Readme.md)

This will create a sample management group structure that you can use for starting point.  

## Move Subscription under management groups

Once the deployment is complete, ensure you move your subscriptions under the desired management groups.

## Next steps

Once you have an environment with your desired management group hierarchy, you can proceed to the next step, Setup GitHub.
