# Deploy Enterprise-Scale reference implementation in your own environment

This section will guide you through the process of deploy an Enterprise Scale reference implementation in your own environment.

If you are performing this on a green field scenario, you can use one of the reference implementations included within Enterprise-Scale (WingTip, AdventureWorks or Contoso reference implementations), as they will create a sample management group structure that you can use to quickly setup a sample Enterprise Scale environment. To deploy a sample Enterprise-Scale reference implementation, simply choose your favorite implementation (for example Contoso) and click on the Deploy to Azure button.


Alternatively, if you've an existing environment with management groups already created and that you want to keep, you don't need to deploy a sample Enterprise Scale reference implementation.

Once you have an environment with your desired management group hierarchy, you can proceed to the next step, Setup GitHub.
