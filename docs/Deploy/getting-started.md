# Getting Started

This article describes how to get started with Enterprise-Scale reference implementation by walking you through prerequisites to deploy a platform-native reference implementation of Enterprise-Scale.
> Note:  Before you start, please make sure that you have read and understood the overall design objective and scope of the reference implementation.

## Target audience

The target audience for this guide DevOps / SRE role and assumes knowledge in Azure Resource Manager (ARM) / Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC), Git, and PowerShell.

## Prerequisites

This table lists the technical prerequisites needed to use the Enterprise-Scale reference implementation. We have chosen to base the reference implementation on PowerShell, but if desired, it is perfectly possible to use other tools such as e.g. Azure CLI for deployment operations.
