# Policies included in Enterprise-Scale Landing Zones reference implementations

Azure Policy and deployIfNotExist enables the autonomy in the platform, and reduces the operational burden as you scale your deployments and subscriptions in the Enterprise-Scale architecture. The primary purpose is to ensure that subscriptions and resources are compliant, while empowering application teams to use their own preferred tools/clients to deploy.

## Why are there custom policy definitions as part of Enterprise-Scale Landing Zones

We work with - and learn from our customers and partners to ensure that we evolve and enhance the reference implementations to meet customer requirements. The primary approach of the policies as part of Enterprise-Scale is to be proactive (deployIfNotExist, and modify), and preventive (deny), and we are continuously moving these policies to built-ins.
- The following tables shows:
  * [ESLZ Custom Policy Definitions](#eslz-custom-policy-definitions) included in the Enterprise-Scale reference implementations
  * [ESLZ Custom Policy Set Definitions](#eslz-custom-policy-set-definitions) (Policy Initiatives) included in the Enterprise-Scale reference implementations
  * [ESLZ Policy Assignments for built-in policy definitions and policy set definitions](#eslz-policy-assignments-for-built-in-policy-definitions-and-policy-set-definitions) in Enterprise-Scale reference implementations

| Deploy SQL Database TDE | Deploys SQL Database Transparent Data Encryption setting for Azure SQL databases | deployIfNotExists, disabled | 1.0.0 | Custom Policy | Yes, recommended | Landing Zone Management Group | SQL |
| Azure Storage deploy a specific min TLS version requirement and enforce SSL/HTTPS | Deploy a specific min TLS version requirement and enforce SSL on Azure Storage | deployIfNotExists, disabled | 1.0.0 | Custom policy | Yes, recommended | Landing Zone Management Group | Storage |
| Storage Account set to minimum TLS and Secure transfer should be enabled | Audit requirement of Secure transfer in your storage account. Secure transfer is an option that forces your storage account to accept requests only from secure connections (HTTPS). Use of HTTPS ensures authentication between the server and the service and protects data in transit from network layer attacks such as man-in-the-middle, eavesdropping, and session-hijacking | deny, audit, disabled | 1.0.0 | Custom policy | Yes, recommended | Landing Zones Management Group | Storage |
| Public network access on Storage Accounts should be disabled | Denies creation of storage accounts using public endpoints | deny, audit, disabled | 1.0.0 | Custom policy | Yes, recommended | Corp Management Group | Storage |
| Deploy Log Analytics workspace | Deploys Log Analytics workspace to an Azure subscription | deployIfNotExists, disabled | 1.0.0 | Custom policy | Yes, recommended | Management, Management Group | Storage |

## ESLZ Policy Assignments for built-in policy definitions and policy set definitions

|Name<br /><sub>(Azure portal)</sub> |Description |Effect(s) |Version | State | Can optionally be assigned when deploying ESLZ | Assignment scope
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---| 
| Azure Security Benchmark | The Azure Security Benchmark initiative represents the policies and controls implementing security recommendations defined in Azure Security Benchmark v2, see https://aka.ms/azsecbm. This also serves as the Azure Security Center default policy initiative. You can directly assign this initiative, or manage its policies and compliance results within Azure Security Center. | audit, auditIfNotExists | 29.0.0 | Built-in policySet | Yes, recommended | Intermediate root Management Group
| Configure Azure Activity logs to stream to specified Log Analytics workspace | Deploys the diagnostic settings for Azure Activity to stream subscriptions audit logs to a Log Analytics workspace to monitor subscription-level events | deployIfNotExists, disabled | 1.0.0 | Built-in policy | Yes, recommended | Intermediate root Management Group
| Enable Azure Monitor for VMs | Enable Azure Monitor for the virtual machines (VMs) in the specified scope (management group, subscription or resource group). Takes Log Analytics workspace as parameter | deployIfNotExists, disabled| 2.0.0 | Built-in policySet | Yes, recommended | Intermediate root Management Group
| Enable Azure Monitor for Virtual Machine Scale Sets | Enable Azure Monitor for the Virtual Machine Scale Sets in the specified scope (Management group, Subscription or resource group). Takes Log Analytics workspace as parameter. Note: if your scale set upgradePolicy is set to Manual, you need to apply the extension to the all VMs in the set by calling upgrade on them. In CLI this would be az vmss update-instances. | deployIfNotExists, disabled | 1.0.1 | Built-in policySet | Yes, recommended | Intermediate root Management Group
| Secure transfer to storage accounts should be enabled | Audit requirement of Secure transfer in your storage account. Secure transfer is an option that forces your storage account to accept requests only from secure connections (HTTPS). Use of HTTPS ensures authentication between the server and the service and protects data in transit from network layer attacks such as man-in-the-middle, eavesdropping, and session-hijacking | deny, audit, disabled | 2.0.0 | Built-in policy | Yes, recommended | Landing Zones Management Group
| Network interfaces should disable IP forwarding | This policy denies the network interfaces which enabled IP forwarding. The setting of IP forwarding disables Azure's check of the source and destination for a network interface. This should be reviewed by the network security team. | deny | 1.0.0 | Built-in policy | Yes, recommended | Landing Zones Management Group
| Deploy Azure Policy Add-on to Azure Kubernetes Service clusters | Use Azure Policy Add-on to manage and report on the compliance state of your Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters. For more information, see https://aka.ms/akspolicydoc. | deployIfNotExists | 1.0.0 | Built-in policy | Yes, recommended | Landing Zones Management Group
| Configure backup on virtual machines without a given tag to a new recovery services vault with a default policy | Enforce backup for all virtual machines by deploying a recovery services vault in the same location and resource group as the virtual machine. Doing this is useful when different application teams in your organization are allocated separate resource groups and need to manage their own backups and restores. You can optionally exclude virtual machines containing a specified tag to control the scope of assignment. See https://aka.ms/AzureVMAppCentricBackupExcludeTag. | deployIfNotExists, auditIfNotExists, disabled | 3.0.0-preview | Built-in policy| Yes | Landing Zones Management Group, Connectivity Management Group
| Kubernetes clusters should not allow container privilege escalation | Do not allow containers to run with privilege escalation to root in a Kubernetes cluster. This recommendation is part of CIS 5.2.5 which is intended to improve the security of your Kubernetes environments.

For more information, see https://aka.ms/kubepolicydoc. | deny, audit, disabled | 3.0.0 | Built-in policy | Yes, recommended | Landing Zones Management Group
| Kubernetes cluster should not allow privileged containers | Do not allow privileged containers creation in a Kubernetes cluster. This recommendation is part of CIS 5.2.1 which is intended to improve the security of your Kubernetes environments. This policy is generally available for Kubernetes Service (AKS), and preview for AKS Engine and Azure Arc enabled Kubernetes. For more information, see https://aka.ms/kubepolicydoc. | deny, audit, disabled | 7.0.0 | Built-in policy | Yes, recommended | Landing Zones Management Group
| Kubernetes clusters should be accessible only over HTTPS | Use of HTTPS ensures authentication and protects data in transit from network layer eavesdropping attacks. This capability is currently generally available for Kubernetes Service (AKS), and in preview for AKS Engine and Azure Arc enabled Kubernetes. For more info, visit https://aka.ms/kubepolicydoc | deny, audit, disabled | 6.0.0 | Built-in policy | Yes, recommended | Landing Zones Management Group
| Virtual networks should be protected by Azure DDoS Protection Standard | Protect your virtual networks against volumetric and protocol attacks with Azure DDoS Protection Standard.
